Creating a novel algorithm that combines Q-learning with A* (Q*) requires integrating reinforcement learning with heuristic search. Here's a high-level concept:

Q-Learning Component: This will be responsible for learning the optimal policy in a given environment, using the standard Q-learning approach.

A Component*: This part will use heuristics to find the shortest path to the goal. The heuristic can be informed by the Q-values learned in the Q-learning phase.

Integration Strategy: The Q-values can be used as a heuristic for the A* algorithm, guiding the search towards more promising paths based on past learning.
